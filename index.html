To understand the story of the company, one must first understand my journey.

Despite initial financial challenges leading to the discontinuation of my BSc Computing at Leeds University, I soon secured a comprehensive computing qualification through an intensive Microsoft/City & Guild partnership program in PC Engineering and Network Technology level 3.
                                                                    </p>

This marked the beginning of an ongoing journey of self-development, where I pursued further education and business development courses in computing.

I delved into Azure, combining self-employment to facilitate my qualifications. Despite lacking solid programming experience initially, I adapted on-the-go to complete tasks for my Azure journey, learning programming languages and other skills as needed.

Unlearning to learn helped eliminate poor habits developed in the past and create room for more and better, facilitating a much needed intellectual "refurbishment"; the program surpassed my expectations, providing not only the desired computer science experience but also intellectual challenges crucial for my career.
                                                                    </p>

I would soon take on CS50P (Introduction to Python) and CS50W (Web Programming with Python & JavaScript). Harvard's CS50 series not only honed my programming skills but instilled in me the thinking process of a computer scientist.

Over the years, I have led and successfully completed several projects related to the completion of each of these programmes. Details can be found on the portfolio.

Unfortunately, due to a series of difficulties that involved immigration, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, my ethnic origins, and others, I found myself unable to find a suitable role. The reason being given would be: Either I did not have the right experience, or I was overqualified. There never seemed to be middle ground for me. The details of my struggles will be discussed separately, that in itself is another story that I will keep for another day – please look out for my biography.

                                                                <div class="turning-point">
                                                                    <p>

I joined platforms like Outlier as an AI Coach Expert, Upwork, and others. I did not have any financial resources, and my computer did not even have the right specifications to finish some of the projects I needed to complete. Furthermore, I felt like I was only using about 20% of my skills and expertise. I knew I could do much better, be more useful to society. That's when it dawned on me to kickstart an IT startup.
                                                                    </p>
                                                                </div>

                                                                <div class="breakthrough">
                                                                    <p>
                                                                        Essentially, I bootstrapped an IT startup with a 64GB Pentium laptop and exactly £0. It was a bold move, but I had to do something, break out of the bubble, break the catch 22. In spite of my humble beginning, in only a short amount of time, I was able to accomplish what can only be termed as a miracle - all my doors opened. Within a quarter, I was able to gain support from Microsoft, which awarded my venture the Microsoft for Start up grant after a meticulous application process. Soon I would get business support through accelerator programmes such as Northern Max, the IEP (Innovator Entrepreneur Programme), AD:VENTURE, instigated collaborative work with local Universities, and more.

When I received a message from Microsoft as a Microsoft for Startup recipient (we get monthly newsletters as members), I saw an advertisement that promoted this programme. Only one problem – Companies had to be based in the USA.
                                                                    </p>

This annual competition aims to bridge the gap in venture capital, ensuring innovators from historically overlooked backgrounds have the resources to scale their businesses in industries such as technology, healthcare, consumer products, media, entertainment, and artificial intelligence. Eligible ventures compete for funding awards ranging from $20,000 to $100,000, alongside exclusive coaching, leadership workshops, networking opportunities, and training with global brands.

Knowing this, I fully expected rejection; but I also knew that applying might be my best chance to be seen by someone who truly cares. So, I did it anyway. Read that again :)

                                                                    </p>

                                                                    </p>

                                <p>Leading development of three innovative applications at Baobab Logix as follows:</p>

                                    <li><strong>AI-Powered Service Delivery Platform</strong> - A secure AI-powered web application that improves company service delivery by facilitating the company's information
                                        access and communication between customers, clients, and staff. The platform is powered by a bespoke Chatbot and a mail server. It uses cutting-edge technology such as LangChain to enable the query of a company-provided
                                        knowledge base by a Large Language Model (LLM) for fast and accurate information retrieval; making the chatbot a source of information that is about as reliable as the information provided in the knowledge base. <br><br>
                                        Unlike LLMs which are based on poorly vetted datasets due to the incredible size needed to train these models, companies maintain complete control over their knowledge
                                        base, which can be provided through various sources (Word, PDF, website, etc.) and indexed into partitioned vector databases for precise information retrieval. This makes the platform a true domain expert that platform users can rely on as a trusted source of reference for the company. 
                                        The dedicated mail server effectively manages support tickets, quote queries, compliments, and complaints. <br><br>
                                        
                                        <strong>The result?</strong> <i>Reduced wait times, improved accuracy and reliability, faster responses, and significantly reduced support delays. As a permanent company asset, expertise remains with the
                                        organization even when critical experts depart, retire, or become unavailable due to. </i>

                                    <li><strong>Event-Oriented Social Media Platform</strong> - A social networking platform
                                        that integrates time management and event planning tools. Users can manage
                                        everything from daily to-do lists to major events like birthdays, anniversaries, and
                                        holidays. Features AI-powered recommendations for gifts, venues, and event
                                        accessories, while maintaining social media functionality for sharing, connecting,
                                        and engaging with others. <br><br>

                                        <strong>The result?</strong> <i>Let's just say: You will no longer forget your wife's birthday again. You may smile now if you wish! :) </i>

                                    <li><strong>Independent AI Directory</strong> - In partnership with Bradford University's internship program, we are establishing an independent directory where the public can find suitable AI products. 
                                        Students will test, review, classify, and score existing and upcoming AI solutions based on an evolving set of criteria, with a particular focus on AI ethics.  
                                        Think of it as "Compare the Market" meets Google, specifically for AI products. The platform is set to launch next academic year. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>The result?</strong> <i>The fast-changing AI landscape can benefit from a dedicated team that tracks AI developments on your behalf, providing greater visibility, along with an independent, 
                                        unbiased platform where the public can compare and identify suitable AI solutions for their problems. Companies can use the platform to monitor and improve their scores. 
                                        Considering its immense power and the undefined unknowns it brings, the uncertainty surrounding AI demands that we make safety and AI ethics a top priority.
